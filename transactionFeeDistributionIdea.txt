step 1) 
   - first we ll create a smart contract which will distribute the transaction fee to 182 wallet.
   - then we will deposit some funds in that smart contract which will be used as the transaction fee to distribute to 182 wallet address.
   - we will keep track or record of the transaction that happens in the chain and from there we will get the trasnaction fee amount that was used for the transaction

step 2) 
    - we will get the transaction fee amount  from the track or record of transaction we kept 
    - after that we will split the transaction fee amount to 182 wallet address like we discuss
    - then finally we will distribute splitted transaction fee amount automatically from the funds that we deposited in the contract  when transaction happens to each wallet i.e. 182 wallets 4
